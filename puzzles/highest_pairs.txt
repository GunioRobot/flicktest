Given two sorted positive integer rrays A(n) and B(n). We define a set S = {(a,b) such that a in A and b in B}. Obviously there are n^2 elements in S. The value of such a pair is defined as Val(a,b) = a + b. Now we want to get the n pairs from S with largest values. The tricky part is that we need an O(n)
algorithm.


A     B
100   134
98    125
90    120
86    115
80    103
76    97
70    90
67    88

N*log(N) algo is as below:
Take an element from each array and add neighbours of elements in the max-heap of size N. Avoid duplication.
