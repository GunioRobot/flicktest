DB notes:


SQL-PLUS:
--------
set feedback on  - give results of query
set linesize 300 - display width to 300.







Tuning:
------
SET AUTOTRACE ON - to explain query once finished. It will print result and then explanation
explain plan for <sql_query> - store plan in sql file for given query
@$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/utlxpls.sql - explain the plan queried from above




Constraints:
-----------
select constraint_name from user_constraints; - show all primary keys etc





Indexes:
-------
Syntax: CREATE INDEX idx_name ON table(col1, col2, ..);
1. Its always good idea to create index after all the data is inserted. 
This will be to applicable where data is usually read-only after inserted.
2. Create index on column where values vary lot (for normal index)
3. Create index on column where values vary very less (for bitmap index)
4. After running query, see explanation of it (using set autotrace on). 
5. If you see any TABLE ACCESS FULL, thats potential place to optimise)

If you plan to query some column with function on it, you should create 'function based index' for that column.
For exa: select * from student where UPPER(last_name) = UPPER('patel') kind of query, create function based index.




Partitions:
-----------
CREATE TABLE tablename(
  col1 NUMBER(10),
    col2  DATE)
PARTITION BY RANGE (col2)
(PARTITION part1 VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('01/01/2011', 'DD/MM/YYYY')),
 PARTITION part2 VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('01/01/2012', 'DD/MM/YYYY')),
  PARTITION part2 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE));

Try to create partition at the time of creating tables. 
This will reduce pain in moving tables if partition is created on running table.
